Create a DLL for DXSDKMESH: Right now for loading OBJ files, we have to write an exe, then run it, then wait for the result, and we have no idea if it was successfull or not, so remake the DXMeshSdk to be a dll not exe (https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMesh)

Redo Shaders: Currently the Shader pipeline is not very customizable, we need to make it better and more user friendly.

Ray-Tracing: Implement Ray-Tracing so we can keep our graphics up to date.
